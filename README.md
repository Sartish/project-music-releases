# Music Releases
Contributors: Sara Carlstein and Ati Takrami

This project was a pair programming project. We build a music release using React. We created react components and featching data from Spotify API. 

## The build & challanges

âœ… The app has React components
âœ…It displays album cover image, album name, the name of each artist involved with a comma between
âœ…Hovering effects:
âœ…it links to the album's external url in the data
âœ…it links to the artist's external url in the data
âœ…The should be responsive: desktop, tablet & mobile.
âœ…We Created CSS rules  so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
âœ…We've provided another API response which includes a list of popular playlists. Use this, along with some new components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.

The challanges we came across was related to props, to get data to flow between the different components, which in turn comes from data from the API. We used google and the technigo community to work out issues.

If we had more time we would get mote information from the API response to make your site richer.
